        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am a third-year Computer Science Engineering student with a growing interest in web development. 
            I recently began my journey in frontend development, 
            and this portfolio website is one of my first projects, built using HTML and CSS.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top:20px;">
             I am highly motivated to expand my knowledge in web development and software technologies. I enjoy solving problems, learning new tools, and turning ideas into functional digital solutions.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top:20px;">
            Currently, I am strengthening my frontend development skills with HTML and CSS while continuously exploring new technologies.
            I am fluent in Marathi, Hindi, and English, and I also have basic knowledge of Japanese. My ability to adapt, learn quickly, and communicate effectively helps me grow both technically and personally.
